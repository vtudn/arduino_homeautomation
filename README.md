# arduino_smarthome

Implemented an Arduino-based home automation system by designing System architecture and Finite-state machine; coding with support from Arduino libraries; simulating with Proteus Design Suite; then connected to Adafruit IO server and Python gateway. Some developed features were: Timer interrupts, Indoor air monitoring, Automatic door, Soil moisture detection and Gas density detection.
