# arduino_homeautomation

**SCENARIO**: Implementation of an Arduino-based home automation system using the following steps: design system architecture and finite-state machine (FSM); develop each module with support from Arduino libraries; simulate with Proteus Design Suite; then connect to Adafruit IO server and Python gateway. Some developed features are: timer interrupts, indoor air monitoring, simple automatic door, soil moisture detection and gas density detection.
